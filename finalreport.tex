\section*{Technical Abstract}
The application of machine learning to calculate a control policy opposed to using control theory could prove to be highly useful when its not possible to determine system dynamics. However, success outside of simulations has been slow. A robotic unicycle is considered in this project with tests into roll limit, sampling time, phone connection and initial orientation being tested first in order to brooch the gap between simulation and real success.

\section{Introduction}
\color{red}
An important section in which you can point out what has been done before and put the project into context. Many students seem to confuse introduction and summary. In this section you explain why you are doing the work. If you don't know, ask your supervisor.

\subsection{Project aims}

\lettrine[nindent=0em,lines=3]{T}he aim of this project is to create a controller that is able to balance a robotic unicycle. The controller starts off with no information about the system, and is therefore required to slowly learn what are good actions to make. This mimics the way in which humans learn new tasks as children by trying new actions and seeing if they're beneficial.
\newline
This is an ongoing project from previous years where success has been shown in simulations yet has so far been hard to achieve in real life. The major outcome for this project is to improve training success on the real unicycle.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Coordinate System}
In order to fully define the unicycle state at each time step seven coordinates and their derivatives are required. These coordinates are shown in figure \ref{fig:ang} giving the state as

\begin{align*}
\textbf{x} = [\dot{x} \: \dot{y}\: \dot{\theta}\: \dot{\phi}\: \dot{\psi}_f\: \dot{\psi}_w \:\dot{\psi}_t \: x \: y \: \theta \: \phi \: \psi_f \: \psi_w \: \psi_t]^T
\end{align*}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Angles used to define position}
  \label{fig:ang}
\end{figure}

In order to define rotations in 3D to represent $\theta,\phi,\psi_f$ correctly care must be taken to the order the rotations are applied. This is because rotations are non commutative in 3D unlike in 2D. The convention of Euler angles is used to solve this problem. \cite{eric}
\newline
There are 12 orders of rotation which can be used. XYZ or 123 convention is used on the unicycle as in equation \ref{eq:eul}. Where $R_A(\alpha)$ represents a right hand rotation about axis A of $\alpha$. 

\begin{equation}
R_{XYZ}(\psi_f,\theta,\phi)\textbf{x} = R_X(\psi_f)R_Y(\theta)R_Z(\phi)\textbf{x}
\label{eq:eul}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Quaternions}

\subsection{Optimal Control}
 
 
%--------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{PILCO}
In policy optimisation an algorithm called PILCO \cite{pilco} will be used.
This method will optimise a policy to decide the best action $\textbf{u}$ given the unicycles state. To determine optimum actions the expected loss over a horizon is evaluated under the current policy, as in equation \ref{eq:pilco}.


\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\pi^*(\textbf{x}) = argmin \sum_0^tc(\textbf{x}^{(i)}) \\
\textbf{u}^{(i)} = \pi(\textbf{x}^{(i)} )\\
\end{split}
\label{eq:pilco}
\end{equation}


%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Gaussian Processes}

A Gaussian process is used to model the dynamics and gives a range of possible functions which fit observed data in a non parametric way as to not introduce model bias. A Gaussian process is a generalisation of a multivariate Gaussian to infinitely many variables. As a result a mean and covariance function are used to define it as in equation \ref{eq:gp}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gp}
\begin{gathered}
f(\textbf{x}) \sim \mathcal{GP}(m(\textbf{x},k(\textbf{x},\textbf{x'})) \\
m(\textbf{x}) = \mathbb{E}[f(\textbf{x})]  \\
k(\textbf{x},\textbf{x'}) = \mathbb{E}[(f(\textbf{x})-m(\textbf{x}))( f(\textbf{x'})-m(\textbf{x'}))]
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}

A major advantage of PILCO is the ability to retain uncertainty throughout this process. This means an initial state distribution can be propagated forward to generate a state distribution at each time step. These distributions are used to calculate the average instantaneous cost in policy evaluation.
The uncertainty grows over time and comes from an initial variation in start position, measurement noise, and process noise. 

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.235\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{u2}

  \caption{Loss prediction}
  \label{sub:ffs}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Predictions from PILCO approach}
  \label{fig:pilco}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{sub:ffffffs} shows predicted x position, with predictions up to 0.5s showing low uncertainty. After this the model loses the ability to predict the state accurately and the state distribution widens. 
A similar trend is observed for the predicted loss at each time step in figure \ref{sub:ffs}.
\newline
PILCO uses an iterative approach to optimising policy. Initially a random controller is used to get sufficient data for a dynamic model. Policy optimisation and rollouts under the new policies can then occur until the task is either learnt or terminated. 
%---------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Cost Function}
A cost function is required to evaluate the performance at each timestep. This takes the form of equation \ref{eq:simple}. Where a, h and $\theta_{max}$ represent positive constants, and d(\textbf{x}) is the geometric distance of the unicycle tip from the starting position.

\section{Current Unicycle Set-up}
\blindtext


\subsection{Mechanical}



\subsection{Electrical}
\subsection{Software}

An Android phone is used as the gyroscope and accelerometer for reading the current state. The sensor data is transmitted from the phone to a computer running the policy script before the required action is transmitted to a raspberry pi to controls the motors.

%----------------------------------

\clearpage
\section{Initial Simulation Results}

During previous years the Unicycles performance on the real model was relatively poor. A mechanical redesign was considered to fix some of these issues. In order to evaluate the performance of this redesign and additional factors simulations were conducted as they allowed a quick and easy way to alter variables.
\newline

%-------------------------------
\subsection{Test Procedure}

Two different measures will be used to determine success. The first being time upright as more rollouts occur. This is to determine any success at balancing the model has. The second is total rollout loss in order to see if success is achieved by staying near the origin instead of staying upright.
%......................................................
\subsection{Roll Limit}
The first factor that would determine the benefit of a large mechanical redesign is the roll limit. In the unicycle model the roll angle cannot exceed 17 degrees. This is thought to inhibit learning as initially the system can't balance and will hit this limit within very few time steps. This could mean the model has insufficient data to successfully learn a policy. Futhermore as the last measurment is removed in real trials due to high accelerations the data available is reduced more. This reduction will have a larger effect on small roll limts and can cause failure to appear to happen at a low cost. Which could in turn inhibit learning more.
\newline
Several designs were sketched to change the roll limit. 42 degrees could be achieved with a new chassis and the same gears, and 47 degrees by changing an additional bracket. Simulations of these can be seen in figure \ref{fig:rolllimit}.
\newline
After 10 random rollouts the roll limit made little difference as in figure \ref{fig:a}. However, when policy optimisation started then a higher roll limit improved success greatly. The change between 42 and 47 degrees appears significant which shows more progress is likely to be made by increasing roll limit further. The plateau observed at 47 degress is due to some tests consistently staying upright for the whole horizon time. When looking at rollout total loss in figure \ref{fig:rl} the same pattern is observed with a higher roll limit reducing the overall rollout loss.
\newline
The variation between simulations can be seen in figure \ref{fig:sd} and shows greater reliability at higher roll limits, with a standard deviation of spread at 47 degrees close to being higher then the mean at 42 degrees. The spread is very important to create a reliable policy training method.
\newline
Higher roll limits could be achieved by changing other parts. 53 degrees would require a 5mm larger wheel. This change would require evaluating the effect wheel size had on performance as well as roll limit.

%-----------------------------------
\subsection{Sampling Time}
Sampling time is another important factor to consider when optimising the training situation of the real unicycle. A faster sampling time effects the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamics change slower and more linearly between readings, decreasing modelling complexity and improving predictions.
\item A zero order hold controller is used on the motors, with torque calculated at the start of a step. As the unicycle moves this action is non optimum, therefore an error is introduced.
\item More data points are collected, this can help build better models but at the expense extra computational time.
\item Every policy call injects noise into the predictions from process and measurement noise. This causes a more uncertain trajectory prediction over the horizon time.
\end{itemize}

Not enough tests have been simulated yet to fully determine the effect. However, new learning behaviours which prioritised distance to origin over just being upright were observed. Therefore showing promise that sampling time can greatly effect learning.
%--------------------------------
\subsection{Future Simulations}
Additional factors are to be simulated to determine the variables that effect learning rate the most. These are the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Higher roll limits with larger wheels.
\item More sampling times.
\item Strength of the cost function.
\item Motor torques.
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}
\subsection{Phone}
\subsubsection{Connection}
Previously the phone connected to the Matlab scrip on the computer using Matlab mobile and wifi. However, this feature has since been removed from Matlab mobile and delays caused by using wifi were believed to occur occasionally. This could introduce extra noise and incorrect state measurements decreasing learning ability.
\newline
HyperIMU \cite{ianovir} was used to replace Matlab mobile. This allowed connection using wifi and USB. The transmission protocol followed was UDP using the packet layout:
\begin{figure*}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.325\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{timestep}
   \caption{Time between measurements}
  \label{fig:ts}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.325\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{delay}
    \caption{Uncalibrated delay}
  \label{fig:td}
  \end{subfigure}
  \begin{subfigure}[t]{0.325\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{both}
    \caption{Different sampling times}
  \label{fig:ts2}
  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{Testing connecting by USB}
  \label{fig:usb}
\end{figure*}
\begin{align*}
[t, a_x, a_y ,a_z , \dot{\alpha}_x, \dot{\alpha}_y , \dot{\alpha}_z \#]
\end{align*}

UDP was chosen over serial communication protocols to take advantage of existing software and allow for wifi to easily be used again in the future if desired.

Tests were conducted to determine the reliability of this method. Figure \ref{fig:ts} shows the time between consecutive measurements on both the phone side and computer side. A mean of 50.89ms and standard deviation of 1.27ms was recorded over 1000 measurements. Variation is undesirable but this is small and times are known so won't prove problematic. A similar spread was observed at lower sampling times as shown in figure \ref{fig:ts2} where a 25ms sampling time resulted in a mean of 25.88ms and standard deviation of 1.38ms. This shows that this software is suitable if faster sampling times are required.
\newline
Due to different clocks on the computer and phone true transmission delay wasn't possible to measure. Figure \ref{fig:td} shows this uncalibrated delay. The majority of packets take one of two times to transmit with a few outliers taking $\pm$2ms. A low variation is desirable as it means actions can be applied for the correct length of time, as to not alter the trajectory away from the policy prediction.


\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.84\linewidth]{all3}
  \caption{Effect of changing transmission medium}
  \label{fig:med}
\end{figure}
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ c | c | c | c }
Test& USB-A & USB-C & WIFI\\ 
\midrule
1&0.99&1.05 &3.02\\
2&1.24& 1.26&1.25\\
3&1.10&1.02 &1.84\\
\end{tabular}
\caption{Transmission delay $\sigma$ in ms}
\label{table:td}
\end{table}
The delay over Three transmission mediums were compared in figure \ref{fig:med}. A smaller number on these graphs corresponds to a faster transmission. It was noticed that the difference between mediums was too large, this was explained when conducting the tests in different orders. The two clock times drifted apart after each test causing the exact delays to be incomparable, therefore flipping test order resulted in the opposite order to the figure. However, the variation in delay is what is most important when deciding method as this is what can cause unexpectedly long applied actions. Wifi showed some delays of nearly a whole time step in figure \ref{fig:med}. The standard deviation was calculated in Table \ref{table:td}. In test two the variation was almost identical amongst methods, but in the other tests wifi again showed greater variation. For this reason either USB connection is a better choice for use on the unicycle. The extra noise introduced by an extra cable effecting dynamics however may outweigh the transmission delay advantage and will need investigating. 
%------------------------------
\subsubsection{Orientation}
Imperfect starting positions in real rollouts can cause a constant offset in position throughout tests unless its determined at the start or learnt. Learning the offset is possible when training however due to the offline nature of rollouts can't be currently done on new runs. Measuring the initial orientation is therefore required, which also allows accurate uncertainty measurements ensuring predictions incorporate as much information as possible.
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
\delta\textbf{a} = \textbf{a}_0 - R\hat{\textbf{a}} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
\theta \\
\psi_f \\
\end{bmatrix} = 
2 \begin{bmatrix}
tan^{-1} ( \frac{\delta\textbf{a}_x}{\sqrt{\delta\textbf{a}_y^2+\delta\textbf{a}_z^2}} )\\
-tan^{-1} ( \frac{\delta\textbf{a}_y}{\sqrt{\delta\textbf{a}_x^2+\delta\textbf{a}_z^2}} )\\
\end{bmatrix}
\label{eq:con}
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
To calculate the initial orientation the roll and pitch angles between transformed accelerometer reading and $\textbf{a}_0 = [0,0,-1]^T$ needs to be determined. The unicycle has only two angular DoF initially, this means that one angle can be set to 0. For this we choose yaw as this angle only depends on the starting position and is penalised when higher. The angles are measured for two seconds before initiating the rollout to estimate initial uncertainty.
\newline
Equation \ref{eq:con} calculates the initial euler orientation. This can then be easily converted to quaternion form with two quaternions rotations : (1 + 0\textbf{i}  + 0\textbf{j} + 0\textbf{k})$R_Y(\theta)R_X(\psi_f)$. Quaternions extend complex numbers to 4D and are required to accuracy keep track of repetitive rotations due to following the same mathematical rules. \cite{arsalan} Quaternion form is then used for all subsequent rotations calculated using gyroscope readings.
A rotation about axis (x,y,z) by $\alpha$ can be defined using the following unit quaternion.

\begin{gather}
\textbf{q} = cos(\frac{\alpha}{2}) + sin(\frac{\alpha}{2})(x\textbf{i} + y\textbf{j} + z\textbf{j}) \nonumber \\
\textbf{q}_{new} = \textbf{q}_{old} . \textbf{q} \nonumber
\end{gather}
